            <h1>Ferrari:The Story</h1><br>
            <p > The company's story officially began in 1947 when the first Ferrari emerged from the historic factory entrance on Via Abetone Inferiore in Maranello. The 125 S, as it was known, embodied the passion and determination of the company's ounder.
Enzo Ferrari was born in Modena on February 18th 1898 and died on August 14th 1988. He devoted his entire life to designing and building sports cars and, of course, to the track. Having been made an official Alfa Romeo driver in 1924, within five years he had gone on to found the Scuderia Ferrari on Viale Trento Trieste in Modena which assisted mostly gentlemen drivers in racing their cars.
                In 1938, Enzo Ferrari was appointed head of Alfa Corse but quit the position in 1939 to set up his own company, Auto Avio Costruzioni, which operated out of the old Scuderia buildings.</p><br>
            <p>The first road car by Ferrari was the 125 Sport. Throughout the 1950s, Enzo Ferrari's fast cars developed a reputation for excellence. Enzo Ferrari felt that many of his customers bought his vehicles for prestige instead of performance, causing him to develop quite a distaste for Ferrari customers.</p><br>

            <p>In November 1961, long-time Ferrari sales manager Girolamo Gardini was let go from the company due to an on-going argument with Enzo Ferrari. Unfortunately, other workers that supported Gardini also left the company at that time. This walkout dealt a big blow to the Ferrari Company during what was already a difficult time. The defectors even formed a new company to compete with Ferrari.</p><br>
            <p>Shortly after this crisis, an new engineer and an experienced racing body man joined the Ferrari Company and finished the GTO, the development of which had been in progress at the time of the split. The GTO went to Sebring and placed first in class. It became one of the most famous sports car ever built.</p><br>
            <p>Ferrari company founder Enzo Ferrari passed away in 1988, and the Ferrari brand quickly became a legend. The value of all Ferrari vehicles, both used and new, rose dramatically. In 2002, Enzo, the fastest model to date, was introduced by Ferrari in honor of its founder. The cost of each Enzo model was $1.8 million. In 2009, a Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa was sold for a record setting $12.1 million.Ferrari also currently offers the special series model SA Aperta. Only 80 models of this type will be built in celebration of the 80th anniversary of Pininfarina, an Italian car design firm in Cambiano, Italy that has been employed by the Ferrari Company for the design of many of their more notable vehicles.</p>
